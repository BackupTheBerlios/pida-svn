    An event dispatcher is the central events object. To use it you must first
    create an event with the ``create_event`` method, this will return an
    event source which is basically the function you'll use to trigger the
    event. After that you register the callbacks. Its usage follows:
    
    >>> dispatcher = EventDispatcher()
    >>> evt_src = dispatcher.create_event ("on-ring-event")
    >>> 
    >>> def callback1 ():
    >>>     print "riiiing!"
    >>> 
    >>> dispatcher.register_callback ("on-ring-event", callback1)
    >>> 
    >>> evt_src ()
    riiing
    >>>
