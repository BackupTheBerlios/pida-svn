PyScintilla2
=====
Author: Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it>

This archive contains modules that allow you to use the Scintilla text
widget from within pygtk2.  Pygtk2 is a Python extensions set that
allow you to use the Gtk2 toolkit in Python programs. The author of
pygtk2 is James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>.

Scintilla <http://www.scintilla.org> is a very powerful editing
component developed by Neil Hodgson <neilh@scintilla.org>. 

PyScintilla2 is partially based on ideas "stolen" from GtkScintilla2, 
a wrapper of Scintilla for GTK2, which is developed and maintained by
Dennis J Houy <djhouy@paw.co.za>. 

Also, there exists a python binding of Scintilla for Gtk+-1.x and
pygtk-0.6.5.  It is named PyGtkScintilla, and it was made by Michele
Campeotto <moleskine@f2s.com>. 

If you have any enhancements or bug reports, please send them to me at
cavada@isrt.itc.it.
