Running pida after installation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If PIDA has been installed, simply issue the command::

  pida

If correctly installed, PIDA will start.

Running pida without installing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``develop.sh`` script in the top-level source directory can be used to run
PIDA without installing system-wide. To execute it, issue the command::

  ./develop.sh

The script generates a PIDA egg in a temporary directory for the duration of
the session.
