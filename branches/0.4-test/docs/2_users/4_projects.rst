Projects
--------

PIDA projects are the way in which PIDA organises a set of files. The default
project type maps to a single source directory, which is then used for quick
navigation and version control functions.

Adding a project to the workbench
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Firstly, from the *Project* menu select *New Project*, and Enter the
information into the newly displayed form.

Name
  The name you would like to use for the project

Save In
  The directory you would like to save the project file in (or the default
  pida projects directory by default).

Type
  The type of project this project is

Once you have entered this information click *ok*.

You will be presented with the initial project configuration dialog for the
project.

Depending on the type of project, you will have different options. The most
common option is *Source Directory*. This is the directory that will be
navigated to when clicking on a project, and the directory that is used for
project functions, including version control. When you are happy with the
configuration, press the *save* button.

Your new project will have appeared on the project list, and is available to
browse and use.

.. note :: The project file may be stored in the project source directory if
  required. The initial value of the project source directory actually
  defaults to the location of the project source file. This allows you to add
  the project file to a version control system and monitor the changes.

Using a project
+++++++++++++++

First, Locate the project list. It is in the pane marked *plugins* and
has an icon signifying a project. This pane will be used to access projects.

Selecting a project from this project list will open a file manager in the
source directory of the project, whatever that is configured to be.

Right-clicking on a project gives the context menu. This context menu is
divided into three sections of contexts.

Directory 
    These are file system actions to be performed on the source directory.

Source Code
    These are version control commands to be performed in the context of the
    project.

Project
    These are actions to be performed on the actual project object, e.g.
    project configuration.

Configuring a project
+++++++++++++++++++++

Projects are configured using the project configuration dialog. To open the
project configuration dialog, either:

1.  Select *Properties* from the *Project* menu.

2.  Right click on a project, and in the context menu, select *Configure this
    project* from the *Project* submenu.

You should click the *Save* button when you have finished and are happy.

The *Undo* button allows you to revert changes to the configuration back to
the last saved state.

The *Cancel* button closes the dialog without saving any changes. Closing the
dialog manually will have the same effect as pressing *Cancel*.
