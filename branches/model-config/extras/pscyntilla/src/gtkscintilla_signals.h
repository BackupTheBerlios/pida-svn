# This file contains code that allow you to use the Scintilla text
# widget from within pygtk2.  Pygtk2 is a Python extensions set that
# allow you to use the Gtk2 toolkit in Python programs. The author of
# pygtk2 is James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>.
# 
# Scintilla <http://www.scintilla.org> is a very powerful editing
# component developed by Neil Hodgson <neilh@scintilla.org>. 
# 
# Also, there exists a python binding of Scintilla for Gtk+-1.x and
# pygtk-0.6.5.  It is named PyGtkScintilla, and it was made by Michele
# Campeotto <moleskine@f2s.com>. 
# 
# PyScintilla2 is partially based on ideas "stolen" from GtkScintilla2, 
# a wrapper of Scintilla for GTK2, which is developed and maintained by
# Dennis J Houy <djhouy@paw.co.za>.
