1. Vim 6.3+
2. Python

4. Python-vte (and lib-vte)
5. Bicycle repair man (for Python features)
6. Gazpacho (for GTK RAD)

These are all commonly available in Linux distributions, but may have slightly
different names. You do not require to use, run or have heard of Gnome.

Installation
--

Enter the source directory, and issue the command:

    python setup.py install

(note: you will need to have root access if you are installing a system wide
copy.)


Upgrading
--

It is advised to remove old installations of Pida if upgrading from version
0.1.* to version 0.2.*. To achieve this automatically, please use the command:

    python setup.py upgrade

This will prompt you as to whether you want to remove previous Pida
installations.

Running
--

Execute the command

    pida


Bugs
--

You must must must please please please report bugs. It is simple, and quick
and by far the most useful thing anyone can do (except fix it!) if they discover one.
Even a quick email to aafshar@gmail.com will be enough.


Feature requests
--

I am always happy to listen to feature requests. Because of the pluggable
nature of Pida, it is easy to extend with plugins.


Enjoy!
