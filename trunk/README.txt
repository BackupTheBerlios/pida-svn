different names. You do not require to use, run or have heard of Gnome.

(note: you will need to have root access if you are installing a system wide
copy.)


Upgrading
--

To be on the safe side, please delete the ~/.pida/pida.vim file.

Bugs
--

You must must must please please please report bugs. It is simple, and quick
and by far the most useful thing anyone can do (except fix it!) if they discover one.
Even a quick email to aafshar@gmail.com will be enough.


Feature requests
--

I am always happy to listen to feature requests. Because of the pluggable
nature of Pida, it is easy to extend with plugins.


Enjoy!
