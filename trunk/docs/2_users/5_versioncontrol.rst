Version Control
---------------

PIDA automatically detects which version control system you are using for a
particular source directory. This allows you to choose the version control
system you wish to use.

PIDA currently supports:

- CVS
- Subversion
- Darcs
- Mercurial
- Monotone
- Bzr
- Arch

Version control is used throughout PIDA in 3 ways which are outlined below.

Project Management Version Control
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The project list states the version control system for a project. When a
project is selected, main version control commands (from the main menu and
main toolbar) will be executed in the source directory of the project,
automatically using the correct version control system.

The version control commands may also be accessed using the context menu
made available by right-clicking on a project.

File Browsing Version Control
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The built-in file browser autoimatically lists version control information
for listed files. This information appears as a standard set of letters
(e.g. *M* for a locally modified file) adjacent to filenames in the browser.

To use this, click on any project, in order to open the browser at the
project's source directory.

When right clicking on a file or directory, you are given a list of version
control commands which can be carried out n the file or directory.
