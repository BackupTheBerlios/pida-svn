Installing PIDA
---------------

If you can get PIDA from your distribution, this is best. Otherwise you will
need to download the source tarball. Unpack the tarball, and in the top-level
directory, issue the command (you may require super user access on your computer for a system install)::

  python setup.py install

PIDA will now be installed in your default python location, and be available
to all users of the system.
